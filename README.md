## Description

Together with LAOLA1.at, Austria's largest sports portal, and Sportradar we developed the most advanced messenger chatbot for the men's football World Cup 2018. It was a fully multi-language virtual assistant with a lot of knowledge around football. (see here the demo video: <http://bit.ly/ToniChatbots-BestOfVideo-FußballWM>)

Now we want to bring this functionality to voice assistants. The underlying technology and natural language processing capabilities of our Toni.ai platform will give us a head start allow us to quickly develop a voice interface.

The voice assistant should be a central hub for all the information around a tournament, so that fans can keep up with all the matches even if they don't watch them. The main focus is on results, upcoming matches, standings, live scores, team and player information as well as statistics.

We already worked on a prototype for Google Assistant back in 2017. By that time sending „push“ notifications was not possible neither on Amazon Alexa not Actions on Google. In the meantime both platforms offer push notifications which we can use to inform users about important events.
